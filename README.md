# InfoVis-Final-Project

Visualized open data about crime and policing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to reveal patterns in criminal activity across the UK utilizing tableau. Applied theoretical concepts of visualising geospatial, multi-dimensional categorical and continuous variables in the data. Created visually appealing, user‑friendly dashboards to let end‑users explore the data easily and effectively. Note that the final report is in the same folder as the README and summarizes our visual analysis based on theory and the ScreenCast folder contains all our explorations of the datasets in tableau in video format.
