# InfoVis-Final-Project

Visualized the Stop and Crime UK dataset to reveal patterns in criminal activity across the UK utilizing tableau. Applied theoretical concepts of visualising geospatial, multi-dimensional categorical and continuous variables in the data. Note that the final report is in the same folder as the README and summarizes our visual analysis based on theory and the ScreenCast folder contains all our explorations of the datasets in tableau in video format.
